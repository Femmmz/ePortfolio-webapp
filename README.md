# eportfolio
Allows users to create accounts. Users can upload their education history, work experience, past projects and more. Employers can use the search feature to look up potential recruits and message them via the chat feature. 

Note- Currently search feature only works in the deployed link since I am currently using a Free Plan of the Algolia and Firebase spark 

## Run locally
`npm install -g firebase-tools`
cd to eportfolio
`npm install`
`npm start`

And now run in the root directory:
`firebase emulators:start`
to start the local database

## deployed link

# Home page
The home page is straight forward where it guides you to sign up or log in with your google or github accounts. After you log in, you can check your profile page or your chat page.
